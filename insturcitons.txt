### Project Description

#### Objective:
The goal is to optimize the video player and client-server communication to improve performance, 
enhance video quality, and ensure faster and more reliable interactions. 
This includes backend and server optimization, and make so all my functions work flawlessly! 



### How to Start the Website

1. Run the server:

   node app.js

2. Open the following URLs in your browser:
   - Main video player: http://localhost:3000
   - Controller page: http://localhost:3000/controller (open this in a new tab or window).
3. On the controller page:
   - Use the two green buttons to select a language, which will trigger different videos.
4. To access the secret admin menu:
   - Tap three times quickly on the bottom-right corner of the screen.
5. Test all the buttons and observe their functionality.
6. Open the admin page: `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
   - The test password is `1234`
   - Test all the buttons here as well and observe their effects on the video player at http://localhost:3000.



### Observed Issues

- The server communication is unreliable. For example:
  - Buttons often require multiple presses to trigger an action, especially the playback and play-forward buttons.
- This system will operate 12 hours a day, 365 days a year, so it must function flawlessly.
- The video player will be displayed on a Samsung TV browser. Therefore:
  - The web app must work seamlessly on any device.
  - It should be fully compatible with touchscreens and function flawlessly across all platforms.



### Requirements

1. Optimize Server Communication:
   - Ensure that all buttons respond reliably on the first press.
   - Improve the speed and reliability of interactions between the client and server.

2. Enhance Video Player Performance:
   - Optimize the video player for smooth playback and minimal latency.
   - Ensure compatibility with Samsung TV browsers and touchscreens.

3. General Improvements:
   - Test and debug the system to ensure it operates flawlessly under continuous use.
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility and consistent behavior across devices.



### File Structure

- index.html: Main video player page.
- /controller: Controller page.
- /admin: Admin page.

I run express nodejs server with sqlite3 database.
